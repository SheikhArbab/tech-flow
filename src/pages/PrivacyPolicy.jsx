                verify your identity by phone call or email. Depending on your request, we
                will ask for information such as your name, the mailing address we have on
                file, or the date of your last communication with us. We may also ask you to

                permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on
                your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. If you are an
                authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual you must
                provide either a copy of the signed permission given to you by the

                principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first
