            This Site is operated by Tech Flow LLc from the State of Illinois and West
            Monroe makes no representation that materials in this Site are
            appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you access this
            Site from other locations, you do so on your own initiative and are
            responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local
            laws are applicable. These Terms are personal to you, and you may not
            assign your rights or obligations to anyone. If any provision in these
            Terms is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining
            provisions will continue in full force and effect. These Terms, your
            rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated by these Terms will
            be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois and associated laws
            thereto, as if the Terms were a contract wholly entered into and wholly
            performed within the State of Illinois, without reference to its
            conflict of law rules. Irrevocable consent is hereby granted by both
            parties to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action or
            dispute in the state and federal courts located in Illinois. Use of this
            website is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not affect to all
            provisions of these Terms, including without limitation this paragraph.

            Section headings are for convenience only and will not in any way limit
            the scope or affect the interpretation of any provision of these Terms.
            No waiver by Tech Flow LLc will be construed as a waiver of any proceeding
            or succeeding breach of any provision. Each provision of the Terms will
            be construed as separately applying and surviving even if for any reason
            one or other of those provisions is held to be inapplicable or
            unenforceable in any circumstances. These Terms will be severable and
            construed to the extent of their enforceability in light of the parties’
            mutual intent if deemed at all unenforceable by the competent court.
            These Terms will supersede any subsequent terms or conditions included
            within this Site. We intend that these Terms constitute the entire
            agreement between Tech Flow LLc and you regarding the subject matter
            contained herein.
